  Inspired by Luke Barousse's analysis of the data job market and the key skills in demand, I was intrigued by his conclusion that Python is the most valuable skill for data roles. However, what fascinated me further was how this analysis might change when focusing specifically on the accessibility of the job market for entry-level/graduate candidates——those who may not yet possess the advanced skills often sought by recruiters.
